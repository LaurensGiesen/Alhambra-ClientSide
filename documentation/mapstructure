# **Map Structure**

To keep the project structured, we'll use the following maps:
- src
    - assets
        - css
        - js
            - pages
            - functions
        - media
            - icons
            - textures
            - figures
    - html
    - images
    
##css
All css files are stored in one map. 
The filename is all in lowercase and is identical to the .html file it refers to.
In case a css file is used for only a part of a file, the name will be as follows:
filename-part.css.

##js
###pages
For each html file, there is one .js file with an identical name. 
This file will contain the DOMContentLoaded 
and the functions that make use of elements on that page.

###functions
In this map, there will be several files that contain js-functions. 
Each file only contains functions of the same subject. 
The file is named after that subject, making use of only lowercase and - to seperate words.

This map contains the files communication.js and config.js.

##media
###icons
Only .png files with icon-like content are placed in this map. 
Each file is renamed to what it contains in lowercase and - is used to seperate words.

###textures
Mainly .jpg files with textures that serve as background for pages and elements. 
Each file is renamed to a comprehensible name in lowercase and - is used to seperate words.

###figures
All images that are used as design but that do not fall under icons. 
Each file is renamed to what it contains in lowercase and - is used to seperate words.

##html 
All .html files (except index.html) are placed in this map. 
Each filed is named as short as possible with only lowercase and -. 
Each name should clearly state what is done on the page.

##images
Only pictures that are added to a html file as `<img>`. It gives content, not just design.
Each picture is renamed with only lowercase and - to seperate words, 
clearly stating what the image represents.
