    <p>When a scoring card is taken by any player (see picture on the right) points are awarded to each player in the game.
        When a player has the most buildings of a certain colour at that moment, he earns the number of points described on the scoring card.
        From the second scoring round the player with the second highest number of buildings of a certain colour
        also receives a number of points. Of course these are less than the player with the highest number of buildings of the same colour.
        In each scoring round more points are awarded. In addition, a player can also earn points for the longest part of the wall
        they have built around their Alhambra. The winner is the player who has collected the most points at the end of the game.
        </p>
