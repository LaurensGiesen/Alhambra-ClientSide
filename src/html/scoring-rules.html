        <p>There are 3 scoring rounds during the game. The first two take place when the scoring cards are
            drawn from the pile of money cards. The third and final scoring round takes place at the of the game.</p>

        <p>When a scoring card is drawn it is put to one side (withdrawn from the game) and the next card or cards are used
            to make the number of money cards up to four. But before the next player starts his turn the scores are calculated.In each
            scoring round, points are awarded to whoever has the most of each kind of building. Players are also given points for the length
            of the wall around their Alhambras. </p>
        <h1>Points for having the most of each kind building. </h1>
        <p>Points are awarded for having the highest number of one of the different kinds of buildings.
            The number of points a player receives depends on which kind of building it is.
            In each case, the player with the most buildings is awarded the points for 1st place indicated on the scoring card next to the name
            of the building. Only the players with the most buildings of each kind receive points when the “1st Scoring Round” card is drawn.
            Points are awarded in the later rounds as follows: in the “2nd scoring round"(which takes place when the “2ndScoring Round” card is drawn),
            points are awarded to the players with the highest number and second highest number of building tiles of each kind.
            If several players tie, the points for the respective places are shared. Points are always rounded down.
            The 3rd round of scoring takes place at the end of the game; points are then also awarded to the players with
            the third highest number of buildings of each kind as shown in the example and on the points table on the tile reserve board.</p>
        <p>Take care: building tiles on the reserve boards are NOT counted towards players' scores.</p>
        <h1>Points for the wall around your Alhambra</h1>
        <aside>
            <div>
                <p>As well as points for buildings, players are also awarded points for the longest joined wall around their Alhambras.</p>
                <p>Each side of the tile with a wall segment on it counts for 1 point.</p>
                <p>No points are awarded for walls which are back-to-back, i.e. internal walls.</p>
                <p>The points awarded to a player are recorded on the scoring board. You can see the score of each player in the circle on their character on the screen.</p>
