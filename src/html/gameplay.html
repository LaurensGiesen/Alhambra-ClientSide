    <h1>Gameplay</h1>


</header>
<main>
    <div>
        <p>Play proceeds in a clockwise direction, beginning with the starting player.</p>
        <p>The player whose turn it is must do one of three things:</p>
        <p><strong>Take some money</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Buy and position a building tile</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Redesign their own Alhambra</strong></p>
        <p>After a playerâ€™s turn is over any money cards and building tiles which have been removed
            are replaced with new ones so that there are always 4 of each.</p>

        <h1>Taking money.</h1>
    <aside>

        <p>A player can take any one of the money cards from those lying face-up, or several money cards
            if they do not add up to more than 5 (the currency does not matter).</p>

        <h1>Buying and positioning building tiles</h1>
        <h2>Buying the tiles</h2>
    <aside>

        <div>
            <p>A player can buy a building tile from the building market. He must pay at least
                the price shown on the tile in the building market. But take care, no change is given!</p>
            <p>The money used to pay for the tile is placed on a discard pile next to the building market.</p>
            <p>If you can pay the exact amount it is still your turn and you can decide
                once more which of the three option you would like to take.</p>
            <p>While it is your turn no new tiles are placed on the building market.
                It is only at the end of your turn that the empty squares are refilled with new tiles.</p>
            <p>It is therefore possible to carry out a maximum of 5 actions during your turn
                (paying the exact amount four times and then either taking money or redesigning your Alhambra. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Positioning the tiles</h2>
        <p>You can either: <br> add your new building tile to your Alhambra or place it on your reserve board.
            You can have as many building tiles on your reserve board as you want.




        <h2>Rules for building your Alhambra</h2>
        <ul>You must build your Alhambra according to the following rules:</ul>
            <li>All building tiles must be the same way round as your starting tile (i.e. all roofs must point upwards).</li>
            <li>Adjoining sides must be the same i.e. they must either both have a wall or both not have a wall.</li>
            <li>You must be able to reach each new building tile "on foot" from the starting tile without crossing a wall and without going off the tiles.</li>
            <li>Each new tile must be joined to your Alhambra by at least one side (i.e. it cannot be joined just at a corner).</li>
            <li>You must not leave any "spaces" (i.e. an empty area surrounded on all sides by building tiles).</li>



        <h1>Redesigning your Alhambra</h1>
            <ul>There are three ways in which you can redesign your Alhambra:</ul>
                <li>You can take a building tile from your reserve board and add it to your Alhambra.</li>
                <li>You can remove a building tile from your Alhambra and put it on your reserve board.</li>
                <li>You can exchange a building tile on your reserve board for one in your Alhambra.
            If you do this the new building tile in your Alhambra must go in exactly the same place as the one you remove.</li>
        <p>When you are redesigning your Alhambra you must still follow the building rules.
            You are not allowed to remove the starting tile or exchange it for another tile.</p>

        <h1>At the end of your turn</h1>
    <aside>
        <div>
            <p>It is only right at the end of your turn - i.e. after any redesigning you may have carried out - that you add the building
                tiles you have bought to your Alhmabra
                or place them on your reserve board. You can add the newly bought building tiles in any order you wish.</p>
            <p>When your turn is over it is the next players' turn. Before the next player decides what to do,
                any money cards or building tiles which have been removed are replaced with
                new ones so that there are four of each again.
                If you reach the end of the money cards the discarded money is shuffled and placed face-down to make a new pile.</p>
